## Overview

[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a web application framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. A key aspect of Shiny is that users can create powerful apps driven by R without having to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. The shiny framework offers a rich set of functions that allow you to create both the user interface, as well as the server logic behind it. Shiny allows us to harvest to power in almost all available R packages, including powerful visualization frameworks such is [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/). 


More recently, however, we see a shift from base R graphics to interactive JavaScript web components and visualizations. Examples of these are [plotly](https://plot.ly/) and [C3.js](http://c3js.org/), which are based on [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). Other examples are interactive maps such as 
those offered by [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) or network visualizations based on [vis.js](http://visjs.org/). In order to use the functionality offered in these frameworks we have to construct R bindings to JavaScript libraries. 


The [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package provides a framework for creating R bindings to JavaScript libraries and allow you to bring the best of JavaScript into R using a set of easy-to-follow conventions.
