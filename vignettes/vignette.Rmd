## Introduction

<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny</a> is a web application framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. A key feature of shiny is that users can create powerful apps driven by R without having to know [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp), or [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). However, incorporating these techniques into your apps can greatly enhance the power of a shiny app.


Furthermore, in recent years there has been a shift from using base R graphics to using interactive JavaScript web components for data analysis and data visualization. In order to use the functionality offered in these frameworks we have to construct R bindings to JavaScript libraries. 


The <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/" target="\_blank">htmlwidgets</a> package provides a framework for creating such bindings and allows you to bring the best of JavaScript into R using a set of easy-to-follow conventions. After a widget has been constructed, embedding it into a shiny app or R Markdown document only takes a few lines of code. For some examples on what htmlwidgets can do take a look at the  <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html" target="_blank">showcase</a> on the main website.


Even though using an htmlwidget is easy, constructing one may be challenging at first as you have to have knowledge of a number of concepts in order to create a widget. These include things as building an R package and having a basic knowledge of javascript, css and html. However, you don't need to be an expert in these techniques to create quite useful new functionality.  


The tutorials below are intended for the intermediate shiny enthusiast with limited experience in html, css and/or javascript, who wants to learn how to extend shiny. A useful first step in this process is to be able to create your own htmlwidgets.


### Creating a dashboard app

The widgets we are going to build are all based on <a href="http://c3js.org/" target="\_blank">c3.js</a>, which in turn is built on the more extensive JavaScript visualization library <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="\_blank">d3.js</a>. C3.js provides a variety of chart types e.g. gauges, pie charts, stacked bar charts, stacked area charts as well as charts to display time series. Furthermore, c3.js provides a variety of [APIs](http://c3js.org/examples.html) and callbacks to access and update the state of a chart after it's rendered.


In order to master the technique of creating widgets we will construct an interactive dashboard application which includes a variety of htmlwidgets based on c3.js. A screenshot of the end result can be seen below. A live version of this dashboard can be seen <a href="https://frissdemo.shinyapps.io/FrissDashboardModule2/" target="_blank">here</a>, while all the code can be found [here](https://github.com/FrissAnalytics/shiny-js-tutorials).   

<p style = "margin:25px">
  <img src = "dashboard.png" width="100%"></img >
  <div style = "text-align:center">the end result of the tutorials</div>  
</p>

<p>
During the course of the tutorials we gradually build up complexity in the functionality the widgets offer. The end result is a fully functional dashboard. An advantage of using JavaScript over base R graphics is that we have access to various types of [events](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp) e.g. hover, click and drag events. For instance, the dashboard has a nice brush-able timeline component. 
</p>

<p style = "margin:25px">
  <img src = "timeline.png" width="100%"></img >
  <div style = "text-align:center">a brush-able timeline which acts as a data filter</div>  
</p>

<p>
The timeline acts as a time based filter for all the data in the other charts. In the tutorials we take a deeper look into the notion of sending data from the client to the server and back using shiny. This functionality is mainly based around three pivotal functions i.e. the JavaScript functions `Shiny.onInputChange`, `Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler` and the R Shiny function `sendCustomMessage`. Each of these will be discussed in detail. A great introduction on these functions is offered in [this](https://ryouready.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/sending-data-from-client-to-server-and-back-using-shiny/) blog post. 
</p>

### Creating a dynamic help system

In addition to creating widgets, you'll learn how to create an interactive, dynamic help system, complete with animated transitions. The help system is based on another JavaScript library namely <a href="http://introjs.com/" target="\_blank">intro.js</a>. This library allows you to create a step-by-step guide for a website. It will draw a nice box around elements of your choice, combined with an annotation layer and a navigation system. Here's an example of how the help will look for one of the gauges in the dashboard. 

<p style = "margin:25px">
  <img src = "help.png" width="100%"></img >
  <div style = "text-align:center">the help system</div>  
</p>


### Dashboard data 

The input data for the dashboard looks like this

```{r echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE,prompt=FALSE, comment=""}
load("data.RData")
library(dplyr)
dd           <- DD.Signaleringen[,c("signaleringid","detectiedatum","branche","product","proces",
                                    "label","eindresultaat","eindargumentatie")]
names(dd)    <- c("id","date","branch","product","proces","label","score","result")
dd$id        <- 1:nrow(dd)
rownames(dd) <- NULL
head(dd)
```

The data corresponds to a toy insurance company who screens new policy applications at underwriting in order to determine if accepting a new policy is risky. 


### Creating your own input binding

We end the tutorials with the creation of a custom [input binding](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/building-inputs.html). Input bindings are components that capture events from the client i.e. the webpage, and send it to Shiny. A simple example of an input binding is an [action button](http://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/actionButton.html). It captures a click event from the user and sends it to shiny. Here we'll create a nice looking toggle switch, based on the [bootstrap-switch](http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/examples.html) JavaScript library. We'll use the switch to toggle a c3.js stacked area chart to display either absolute counts or percentages. Here's an example of the switch we will be creating. Press the button and see what happens!

<script src="bootstrap-switch.min.js"></script> 

<p>
  <div style = "width: 150px; margin: 25px auto">
  <input type="checkbox" id="test" checked data-label-width="auto" class="FrissSwitch" data-size="mini" data-on-color="success"   data-off-color="danger" data-label-text="Use percentage"/>
  <script>$("#test").bootstrapSwitch();</script>
  <script>$("#test").bootstrapSwitch("state",true);</script> 
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  <div style = "text-align:center">an example of a custom input binding in the form of a toggle switch</div>  
</p>


## Stand alone examples

We will start with the most simple visualization c3.js offers i.e. a gauge. Before involving R and shiny we will make a simple stand alone JavaScript HTML version to show how the component and c3.js work in general.


Each stand alone example is presented in a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net//" target="_blank">jsfiddle</a>, which is a webpage where you can interactively run HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. By clicking "Edit in JSFiddle" in the panel below you can alter the code and see what the effect of your change is. Working with fiddles is a great way to learn how a specific library or piece of code works. For example, by changing the value 75 on the first line of the JavaScript panel and clicking on the "Run" button in the left corner you will see the value of the gauge change.

## Recipe to construct charts

Typical steps to generate a chart are to

1. include library specific css and javascript files
2. create a container element in which we can house the chart
3. make sure we have data in the right format to feed to the chart
4. render the chart in the container using library specific instructions

optionally,

5. send updates to the chart e.g. update its data or update parameters that alter the appearance of the chart


## A first example

Here is the complete code for our first example. This code corresponds to [example_01_gauge.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FrissAnalytics/shiny-js-tutorials/master/examples/example_01_gauge.html) in the examples folder of [this](https://github.com/FrissAnalytics/shiny-js-tutorials/tree/master/examples) repository.

```html
<html>
<head>
	<link href="c3.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>

<div id="chart1"></div>

<script src="d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="c3.min.js"></script>

<script>
var gaugeData = {data: 75};	
  
var chart1 = c3.generate({
  bindto: '#chart1',
  data: {
    json: gaugeData,
    type: 'gauge',
  },
  gauge: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  }
});
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down this code into the steps stated in the previous sections.


### step 1

In our example we include one css file and two JavaScript files. This happens at lines 3, 9 and 10, respectively. The [css](http://www.w3schools.com/css/) file describes how to style elements on the screen, while the JavaScript files implement the logic to render and update the charts. Here the exact position where we include these files in the code is not important, however, it may affect how fast a page can be rendered, depending on the size of the includes. 



### step 2

Creating a container element is very easy. Almost always it can be a simple [div](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp). The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. In our case it looks like this

```html
<div id="chart1"></div>
```

Here we have given the div an id. The value of this id is unique and helps us to locate the element later on. In general, it greatly helps to have a basic understanding of HTML [elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) and [css selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) such as [ids](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asp) and [classes](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp). Luckily, a basic understanding is often all you need and not hard to obtain. W3Schools offers a great set of quick, easy to understand tutorials in [HTML](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) and [JavaScript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp). Take a look as these will really help you obtain a basic understanding of these frameworks, which is crucial if you want to develop your own components and bindings. 

The most important part here is this:

> We want to be able to create elements on a page and to target them in order to be able to call a function on them, which will alter the state and content in that element. 


### step 3


Step 3 is often the most difficult step. Besides data collection, cleaning and organizing e.g. using [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) and [tidyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), we must send data from shiny to the web browser. R, however, works with dataframes, vectors and lists, while JavaScript works with things like [objects](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp) and [arrays](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) and often uses [JSON](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json.asp) to describe data. 


In the end, whatever we use in R must be translated into something the browser understands. Unfortunately, each chart library has its own conventions on how the data should be represented. As a widget builder it is your task to make the translation from R to JavaScript.   

In the example above the JavaScript data looks like this

```javascript
var gaugeData = {data: 75};	
```

Here we have created a variable called `gaugeData`. In JavaScript this would be an example of an object, which has a key / value pair with a *key* called data and a *value* of 75. 


When we are in R and want to set the value of the gauge to 75, we must make sure the final data the chart looks like this. In this case the data representation we're after is simple. However, in general this often is harder.


Internally, shiny and htmlwidgets use the R package [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) to convert R data stuctures to JSON. For more information, take a look at the package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html) for an easy starter. Especially useful are the `fromJSON` and `toJSON` functions. The first tells you how an R object will be translated into JSON, while the latter does the reverse. Just play around to see how it works!


For a quick example in R run this


``` r
if (!require("jsonlite"))
  install.packages("jsonlite")
  
library(jsonlite)
toJSON(list(data = 75)) 

```

### step 4

At this point we have included the required css and js scripts, set up a container element with an id equal to `chart1` and have constructed a JSON dataset called `gaugeData`. We are now ready to construct the chart. 

Unfortunately, different chart libraries use different conventions to set up charts, so the code you see below will be very specific to c3.js. However, learning this example helps to understand other libraries as well. The important part is that you understand which steps are needed, not specifically what syntax is used. Remember, a good chart library already makes it easy to construct a chart and given some examples the syntax is often easy to master. Luckily c3.js comes with many examples, for some inspiration take a look at [these](http://c3js.org/examples.html)!


All c3.js components are initialized by calling the function `c3.generate`. This function takes a single object as its argument which supplies c3 with all information it requires to generate the component. In the example above the relevant code chunk looks like this:


```javascript
var chart1 = c3.generate({
  bindto: '#chart1',
  data: {
    json: gaugeData,
    type: 'gauge',
  },
  gauge: {
    min: 0,
    max: 100
  }
});
```


The first item in this object is `bindto` which tells c3 which [element](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) on the HTML page we want to target to put the component into. Here value is `#chart1`. This string is an example of what's known as a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp" target="_blank">CSS selector</a>. The # symbol is CSS syntax which tells the browser to select an element from the HTML page with the specific id, which value comes after # symbol. 


Next we pass in the previously constructed javascript variable `gaugeData`, which holds the data for the chart. 

```javascript
var gaugeData = {data: 75};	
```

Here the data is provided as a key value pair with the name 'data' and value 75. Naming the data is not required for the gauge but when we extend the visual later on the data needs to be named. In actual widgets the data is usually passed from R to the browser by shiny, which internally relies on the R library [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html). In the example above, however, we manually created the data object.


In the code chunk below we pass the variable holding the data and in addition tell c3 that we want to construct a chart of type 'gauge'

```javascript
data: {
  json: gaugeData,
  type: 'gauge'
}
```

C3 has different ways of providing components with data (see [here](http://c3js.org/examples.html#data)). In our examples we typically pick the JSON format as shiny uses jsonlite to convert R data structures to JSON (see above). 

Finally, we supply the component with some gauge specific options which in this example are the minimum and maximum values of the gauge.

```javascript
gauge: {
  min: 0,
  max: 100
}
```

## Extending the gauge

A key aspect of a good widget is the possibility to update the data *after* we have constructed the chart. Before we do this from shiny, we'll extend our first example by updating the data via JavaScript. First, we want to pass some more options to the chart. Subsequently, we update the value of the gauge, after the chart is initialized.  

<iframe width='100%' height='300' src='http://jsfiddle.net/FrissAnalytics/tx38gstp/9/embedded/result,js,html' allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' frameborder='0'></iframe>

Here is the code for the complete example.

```html
<html>
<head>
	<!-- required css style file for c3.js -->
	<link href="c3.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>

<!-- container element in which we will create the chart -->
<div id="chart1"></div>

<!-- required javascript libraries-->
<script src="d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="c3.min.js"></script>

<!-- javascript block to render and update the chart-->
<script>

	var gaugeData = {'data': 80.0}
  
	// create a chart and set options
	// note that via the c3.js API we bind the chart to the element with id equal to chart1
	var chart = c3.generate({
		bindto: '#chart1',
		data: {
			json: gaugeData,
			type: 'gauge',
		},
		gauge: {
			label:{
				//returning here the value and not the ratio
				format: function(value, ratio){ return value;}
			},
			min: 0,
			max: 100,
			width: 15,
			units: 'value' //this is only the text for the label
		}
	});
	
	// this function will update every 2000 milliseconds
	// and create a new value between 0 and 100
	setInterval(function () {
		
		// create a random value between 0 and 100, rounded to 2 digits
		var newValue = Math.floor(100 * Math.random());
		
		// create a data array holding the random value
		var newData = {'data', newValue };
		
		// tell the chart to load the new data
		chart.load({
		  json: newData
		});
    }, 2000);
		
		
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code corresponds to "example_02_gauge.html" in the examples folder of [this](https://github.com/FrissAnalytics/shiny-js-tutorials) repository.

Compared to the first version we changed the gauge display options. For instance, in the initialization object passed to `c3.generate` we set a `label` argument to a format *function* that renders the display text in the middle of the gauge as by default the gauge displays a given value as a percentage related to the maximum and minimum value for that gauge. In our case though we just want to display the value we supply to it. Of note, many of the auxiliary formatting functions used by c3.js actually come from its big brother i.e. [d3.js](https://d3js.org/). Luckily, most of the time we don't need these.

```javascript
label:{
  //returning here the value and not the ratio
  format: function(value, ratio){ return value;}
}
```

The format function has two arguments: the value and the ratio which is the ratio between the set minimum and maximum. Because we simply want to display the value we return it without altering it in anyway.

We also added some styling options to change the width of the gauge and the text displayed below the value.

```javascript
width: 5,
units: 'value' //this is only the text for the label
```

In the example above we wrapped the code to update the value of the gauge into another function, called  <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp' target='_blank'>setInterval</a>. SetInterval is a standard javascript function that repeatedly executes a given function every ms milliseconds.


```javascript
setInterval( functionDefinition , ms );
``` 

In our case the complete function call looks like this

```javascript
setInterval(function () {
	
	// create a random value between 0 and 100, rounded to 2 digits
	var newValue = Math.floor(100 * Math.random());
	
	// create a data array holding the random value
	var newData = { 'data': newValue };
	
	// tell the chart to load the new data
	chart.load({
	  json: newData
	});
  }, 2000);
```
Here we supplied the function we want to be executed as a so called [anonymous function](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp), which means we directly pass in the function definition without assigning it a name. Another way would be to first create a named function and then to pass the name of that function as a first argument to `setInterval`.


Inside the anonymous function we draw a random number and use it to create a new data object, using the same name as before i.e. 'data'.

```javascript
// create a random value between 0 and 100, rounded to 2 digits
var newValue = Math.floor(100 * Math.random());
	
// create a data array holding the random value
var newData = { 'data': newValue };
```

Finally, we tell c3.js to load the new data to the already existing gauge.

```javascript
chart.load({
  json: newData
});
```

Note that here we reference the chart object we created earlier and call the method `load` on it. You can think of [methods](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp) as special functions that are part of a javascript object. Typically, methods perform actions on objects e.g. to set or retrieve values. In this example the object is the chart, while the method is called `load`. C3 has many methods depending on the specific chart, click [here](http://c3js.org/reference.html#api-focus) for a complete overview.


At this stage we have covered all ingredients to make a fully functional gauge. Time to create a real htmlwidget! 

## Creating the widget

By running the snippet below you will install the htmlwidgets and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html" target="_blank">devtools</a> packages which we will both use to develop our widget.

```R
install.packages("htmlwidgets")
install.packages("devtools")
```

Devtools is an R package which contains various utility functions to assist in R package development and in this tutorial we will use some of them.

The htmlwidgets provides an easy to use function to set up a template for your widget. By running the following code snippet in R you will create a new R package containing template code which we can use to build our widget.

```R
devtools::create("C3")                                    # create package using devtools
setwd("C3")                                               # navigate to package dir
htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget("C3Gauge","c3",edit=FALSE)    # create widget scaffolding
devtools::install()                                       # install package so we can test it
```

The scaffoldWidget function is the function which creates the actual template. With the first argument we specify the name we want our widget to have. The second optional argument is the name of a javascript package on <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">bower</a> we want to use. Bower is a web component manager which you can use to install a component and all its dependencies. When you run the above command you can see c3.js and its dependencies d3.js are downloaded and put in the package folder we just created. You can find them in the folder C3Gauge/inst/htmlwidgets/lib. The lib folder is the default location for all the external libraries you will use in your widget. We set edit to FALSE because for now we do not want to open an editor to edit our files.

To check if everything works we install our newly created package and with the next snippet you load the package we just created and run the template code which should display a simple "hello world!" message in the viewer pane in RStudio.

```R
library(C3)
C3Gauge("hello, world")
```

The scaffoldWidget widget function created a number of files and directories for us. Firstly an "htmlwidgets" directory is created within the "inst" directory of our C3Gauge package. The "inst" folder is a generic R package folder where all external package dependencies are stored. We use this whenever we want to include files in our package.

Within the "inst" folder an "htmlwidget" subfolder is created. Here you'll find the following files:

  -C3Gauge.js: This file contains the client side code of our binding. In our case this will be the javascript code described in the above examples extended with some extra logic to handle data coming from R.
  <br>
  -C3Gauge.yaml: This file lists all dependencies and their location in the folder structure for the widget. Because we used bower to get all the external dependencies we need this file is already properly filled.
  
Within this folder we find the lib folder which contains the files external javascript library files for c3.js and d3.js as automatically downloaded from bower.

In the main folder of our project we find an 'R' folder with the file "C3Gauge.R" which contains a template function 'C3Gauge' which has data and sizing information as arguments, propagates this information to the right javascript code and then displays the widget.

Besides this function an output and a render function is created which we can use to integrate our widget in a Shiny app.

Lets take a closer look at the C3Gauge.js code.

```javascript
HTMLWidgets.widget({

  name: 'C3Gauge',

  type: 'output',

  factory: function(el, width, height) {

    // TODO: define shared variables for this instance

    return {

      renderValue: function(x) {

        // TODO: code to render the widget, e.g.
        el.innerText = x.message;

      },

      resize: function(width, height) {

        // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size

      }

    };
  }
});
```

We see a call to the HTMLWidgets.widget function which has three arguments: a name, the type of widget (currently only output is supported) and a factory method which returns two functions; "renderValue" which will contain the code to setup our widget and "resize" which will take care of any re-sizing code if needed.
A factory method is the name of general software design pattern where we use a function to create object instances.

Above we see that the factory method has three arguments: el, width and height. el is the element created by htmlwidgets where we can put our widget in. By default htmlwidgets creates an empty div just like we did in the standalone examples above. If you want to create a widget winch requires a different tag or more elaborate HTML code it is possible to create custom HTML which is described <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/develop_advanced.html#custom-widget-html" target="_blank">here</a>

As a first step you can copy the code from our example in the above javascript template to the body of the renderValue function inside C3Gauge.js without using any data passed on from R.

```javascript
      renderValue: function(x) {

      	var gaugeData = {'data': 80.0};
  
      	// create a chart and set options
      	// note that via the c3.js API we bind the chart to the element with id equal to chart1
      	var chart = c3.generate({
      		bindto: el,
      		data: {
      			json: gaugeData,
      			type: 'gauge',
      		},
      		gauge: {
      			label:{
      				//returning here the value and not the ratio
      				format: function(value, ratio){ return value;}
      			},
      			min: 0,
      			max: 100,
      			width: 15,
      			units: 'value' //this is only the text for the label
      		}
      	});
              
      },
```

If we re-install our package, reload the library and execute the C3Gauge function we can see the example is rendered in R.

```R
devtools::install()                                      
library(C3)
C3Gauge("")
```

Lets now take a look at the R code inside C3Gauge.R to see what we must do in order to render the gauge with a value specified in R.

```R
C3Gauge <- function(message, width = NULL, height = NULL) {
  
  # forward options using x
  x = list(
    message = message
  )
  
  # create widget
  htmlwidgets::createWidget(
    name = 'C3Gauge',
    x,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    package = 'C3'
  )
}
```

The function is by default created with three arguments: message, width and height. We can extend the number of arguments whenever we need to pass on additional information to our widget.
In the default code the message argument is any data that is passed on to the renderValue function in the C3Gauge.js code. The width and height information is passed on to the resize function in the same file. For the charts in the c3.js library we dont need to explicitly resize the component as the components adjusts its size to the div it is in. 

The body of the function consists of two parts, first a list called x is created which will contain all data passed on to the widget. Next the htmlwidgets::createWidget function is called with a name, our data, the sizing information and the name of package our widget is in.
Based on the name and the package and the widget name the function knows which javascript files to use.

If we look back at how we initialized our data in the stand alone examples we can see the gauge wants the data to be in the flowing format in javascript:

```javascript
{'data': 80.0}
```

By default htmlwidgets uses the toJSON function from the jsonlite package to convert data from R to JSON format. Using a different function for the conversion is possible in case toJSON function does not suffice. How to do this is explained in the <a href="http://www.htmlwidgets.org/develop_advanced.html">advanced development</a> page on the htmlwdigets website.

We can experiment with how our data will look in javascript by calling the jsonlite::toJSON() function with various values. If we look at the javascript code above we see we need a json object with an element called data with a numeric value.
If we make a named list in R with one element called data and a numeric value we will get exactly this output. We can run the code snippet below to verify this.

```R
  x <- list(data=80)
  jsonlite::toJSON(x)
```

This results in 

```javascript
{"data":[80]} 
```

The added brackets simply mean that the data has become a one dimensional array which is equivalent to a single value.

In order to get the data in the form above we only have to rename the message to data in the C3Gauge function inside C3Gauge.R and we will get the proper JSON object we want.

```R
  # forward options using x
  x = list(
    data = message
  )
```

Going back to our javascript code in C3Gauge.js we have to make one modification: we remove the line where we create gaugeData abd in stead of passing our static gaugeData to the C3 generate function we pass on our list created in R. We change the line where our data is specified to the following.

```javascript
    json: x
```

After rebuilding and installing the package we now have a fully function gauge we can call from R with the following line.

```R
  devtools::install()                                      
  library(C3Gauge)
  C3Gauge(50)
```

The code in C3Gauge.R now looks like this:

```R
#' <Add Title>
#'
#' <Add Description>
#'
#' @import htmlwidgets
#'
#' @export
C3Gauge <- function(message, width = NULL, height = NULL) {

  # forward options using x
  x = list(
    data = message
  )

  # create widget
  htmlwidgets::createWidget(
    name = 'C3Gauge',
    x,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    package = 'C3Gauge'
  )
}
```

And the code in C3Gauge.js now looks like this:

```javascript
HTMLWidgets.widget({

  name: 'C3Gauge',

  type: 'output',

  factory: function(el, width, height) {

    // TODO: define shared variables for this instance

    return {

       renderValue: function(x) {

        // create a chart and set options
        // note that via the c3.js API we bind the chart to the element with id equal to chart1
        var chart = c3.generate({
            bindto: el,
            data: {
                json: x,
                type: 'gauge',
            },
            gauge: {
                label:{
                    //returning here the value and not the ratio
                    format: function(value, ratio){ return value;}
                },
                min: 0,
                max: 100,
                width: 15,
                units: 'value' //this is only the text for the label
            }
        });
              
      },

      resize: function(width, height) {

        // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size

      }

    };
  }
});
```

## Coming tutorials
In the next tutorial we will put the widget we just created in a shiny app and add some code to our widget such that it updates with smooth transitions. Furthermore we will create widgets for the c3 piechart, line bar chart and stacked area charts.
