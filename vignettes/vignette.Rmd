## Overview

[Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a web application framework that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. A key feature of shiny is that users can create powerful apps driven by R without having to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.


More recently, however, we see a shift from base R graphics to interactive JavaScript web components and visualizations. In order to use the functionality offered in these frameworks we have to construct R bindings to JavaScript libraries. 


The [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) package provides a framework for creating such bindings and allow you to bring the best of JavaScript into R using a set of easy-to-follow conventions. After a widget has been constructed, embedding it into a shiny app or R Markdown document only takes a few lines of code. For some examples on what htmlwidgets can do take a lot at the [showcase](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html) on the main website.


Even though using an htmlwidget is easy, constructing one may be challenging as you have to have knowledge on a number of things. These include things as building an R package, knowing javascript, css and html.
