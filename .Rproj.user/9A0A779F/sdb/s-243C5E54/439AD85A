User can easily create powerful apps driven by R without having to know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. It comes with a rich set of functions that allow you to create both the user interface, as well as the server logic behind it.\n\n\nShiny comes with a ton of features and can harvest the power of almost all R packages right out of the box. More recently, however, we see a shift from base R graphics to interative javascript web components and visualization. Many of these use modern frameworks such as [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to create interactive charts e.g. [plotly](https://plot.ly/) or [C3.js](http://c3js.org/). Other types of applications involve interactive maps suchs as [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) or network visualizations based on [vis.js](http://visjs.org/). In addition to these, we may wish to create shiny applications involving interative help pages based on [intro.js](intro.js), or create fullscreen scrolling web applications based on [fullpage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/).\n\n\n",
